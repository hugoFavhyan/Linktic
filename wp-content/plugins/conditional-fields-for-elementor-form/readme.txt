Add conditions to Elementor form fields to hide or show a form field based on inputs from other fields, using if-else conditional logic.

== Description ==

**[Conditional Fields for Elementor Form](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get-pro&utm_content=plugin-name)** is an addon for Elementor that helps you apply conditional logic to Elementor form fields. You can hide or show fields based on the input values from other form fields.

* Basically, it utilizes **"If condition"** logic. For example, if condition A is true, then field XYZ will be visible; otherwise, it remains hidden within the Elementor form.

**Elementor Pro does not support conditional logic inside its form widget fields, so we created Conditional Field addon. It provides you with the option to enable conditions on Elementor form fields, allowing you to hide or show a form field based on the inputs from other fields.**

**NOTE:** This addon is only compatible with the Elementor Pro version because the form widget is not available in the free version of Elementor.

### PLUGIN FEATURES
— —————————————- —

* **[Show / Hide Fields Conditionally](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get-pro&utm_content=view-demos#demos)**
 Easily add conditional logic to show or hide any field within an Elementor form based on values from other fields. Currently, you can add conditions to these fields: **text, textarea, email, telephone, URL, radio, select, file upload, HTML, number, and checkbox.**

* **If / Else Logic Without Code**
 Apply if/else logic to form fields without coding. Simply add the ID of the field through which you want to apply a condition. For example, if the "Query Type" field ID is "query_type," you can set it to show the "Enter Order ID" field if "query_type == check-order-status" and hide it otherwise.

* **Apply Multiple Conditions**
 Apply multiple conditions to a form field, and actions will be triggered if all conditions are met, using AND logic.

* **No Validation Errors**
 You will not encounter validation errors if a required field is hidden due to a condition.

== Installation ==

### Quick Installation

1. Navigate to **"wp-admin >> Plugins >> Add New"** on your WordPress website, search for **"Conditional Fields for Elementor Form"**, and install and activate this plugin developed by [Cool Plugins](https://coolplugins.net/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=homepage).
2. Install **"Elementor PRO"** to access this plugin’s features, as the form widget is only available in the Elementor Pro version.
3. Edit a page with Elementor and create a form. In the form fields, you’ll find a conditions tab where you can easily apply conditions.

### How to Add Conditions to Elementor Form Fields?

#### Step 1:
First, install **"Elementor Pro"**, then install **"[Conditional Fields for Elementor Form](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get-pro&utm_content=installation)"**. Since it is an addon for Elementor Pro, Elementor Pro must be installed first.

#### Step 2:
After installing both plugins, edit a page with Elementor where you intend to add a form. Create the form using the Elementor form widget and add the desired fields.

#### Step 3:
Select the field you wish to hide or show based on specific conditions.

* For example, in a contact form, you might want to show the **"Order ID"** field only if the user selects **"Order Status"** in a query-type select/option field, and hide it if **"General Query"** is selected.
* Enable conditions on a field via the **"conditions tab."**
* Choose a display mode, either **hide or show**. For example, if you select **"Show"**, the field remains hidden until the condition is met. Conversely, the **"Hide"** option keeps the field visible until the condition is met. The pro version of this addon adds two more modes: **Enable/Disable**, allowing you to enable or disable an input field based on conditions.
* Create a condition by entering the ID of the field against which you want to compare the value. For example, you might enable a condition on the **"Order ID"** field so it becomes visible if **"query-type = order-status"**.
* You can also apply multiple conditions to a field and link them using an **AND operator**, meaning the field will hide or show if all conditions are met. The pro version also supports an **OR operator**, allowing a field to hide/show if any condition is met.
* Conditions can be compared in several ways, such as **is equal to (==), is not equal to (!=), greater than (>), and less than (<)**. The pro version supports many other comparison conditions like **empty, not empty, contains, does not contain, starts with, ends with**, etc.

#### Step 4:
Save or update the page and see the results and actions!
